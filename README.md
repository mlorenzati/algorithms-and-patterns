# Algorithms and patterns
Design and implementation of efficient software using algorithm analysis, data structures, and repeatable design patterns.
This is the repository for the postdegree in embedded system @ IUA

# Description
This repository focuses on developing skills for designing and implementing effective, efficient software.
It covers algorithm analysis, data structures, and practical problem-solving while capturing best practices through reusable design patterns.
The approach combines engineering principles with functional block architecture to produce clear, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.

# Disclaimer
All examples where migrated from Java original code from Ms Valerio Fritelli for the Algorithms and patterns class

# Chapters
Each chapter cover a specific area of algorithms and design patterns

## Chapter 1

## Chapter 2
Sorting algorithms 

# Build
Enter each chapter and:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 4
```
