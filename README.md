# algorithms-and-patterns
Design and implementation of efficient software using algorithm analysis, data structures, and repeatable design patterns.

# description
This repository focuses on developing skills for designing and implementing effective, efficient software.
It covers algorithm analysis, data structures, and practical problem-solving while capturing best practices through reusable design patterns.
The approach combines engineering principles with functional block architecture to produce clear, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.
